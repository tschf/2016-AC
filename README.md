### Logo

The application logo uses a German Map (src/img/DE.png) which was sourced from https://github.com/googlei18n/region-flags. According the the `COPYING` documentation, these were grabbed from Wikipedia and checked to be in the public domain or exempt from copyright.

### Map Visualisation

The visualisation for the map was created by using:

* D3JS - https://github.com/mbostock/d3; and
* TopoJSON - https://github.com/mbostock/topojson
